  visionParagraphText: 'For a low monthly cost, Vision Insurance can cover many of the expenses specific to vision care, including exams and eyewear (both eyeglasses and contact lenses). In most cases these plans offer discounts and/or limited coverage to reduce the overall cost of these expenses. This coverage may also allow for discounts on vision corrective surgeries, such as LASIK and PRK.',

  visionSidebarFirstSubheaderText: "The simple math of vision insurance\n\nUnlike some other types of insurance, you don't purchase vision insurance to keep you protected from a crisis or catastrophic event that could result in a heavy financial burden. However, vision insurance can be a good call to simply save you money on expenses that are a necessity for many people due to not-so-perfect vision. Vision expenses can be costly, so vision insurance at low monthly rates can cover some of the ongoing costs as they add up year over year.",
