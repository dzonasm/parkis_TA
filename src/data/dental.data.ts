  dentalOfferDescription: 'Dental insurance covers expenses specific to dental care, including both preventive care and emergency or unplanned dental work. Depending on the plan selected, it may also cover some special dental needs, such as orthodontia. Most plans will pay most if not all of your preventive care costs such as routine exams, x-rays, and fluoride treatments. For other dental costs such as fillings and extractions, you may pay for some or all of your expenses until a certain threshold is met per year, which will vary by plan.',
